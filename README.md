>UPDATE 1/1/26 - migrating to new structure to accomodate bookdown.org being depreciated. Rendering within /slides folders with Quarto duplicating into /docs such that slides can be hosted on GitHub pages. Bookdown.org urls will likely extinguish at end of 2026 (no intent to re-deploy, all files are within this repo if anyone is interested in them).

The weekly sessions are titled, "R for Authoring" (or, sometimes, "R is for Authoring"). While we're not technically (mostly) authoring with "R", but rather plain text supported by markdown and/or LaTeX within processors purportedly intended to process (primarily) quantitative data, it's important to acknowledge an inspirational source for the intentional misnomer: 

> "Another noteworthy characteristic of this manual is that it doesn't always tell the truth... ...the author feels that this technique of deliberate lying will actually make it easier for you to learn the ideas" (Knuth, pp. vi-vii)

Made a big change on 8/12/25 moving all previous material into "Year" folders because the main folder was getting too cluttered. This means the "2023" and "2024" `.qmd` files will likely not render without user amendment (you'll have to look for/alter path locations in many of the `.qmd`s - this should primarily affect image files located in an `img` folder, but there may be other consequences). Sorry! Please message me if there's any issues or questions!!! 😇
