Made a big change on 8/12/25 moving all previous material into "Year" folders because the main folder was getting too cluttered. This means the "2023" and "2024" `.qmd` files will likely not render without user amendment (you'll have to look for/alter path locations in many of the `.qmd`s - this should primarily affect image files located in an `img` folder, but there may be other consequences). Sorry! Please message me if there's any issues or questions!!! ðŸ˜‡
