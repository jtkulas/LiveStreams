### For R Markdown

Yes, there are a few R packages specifically designed to facilitate embedding content via iframes in R Markdown documents (primarily for HTML output). These handle scenarios like embedding web pages, Shiny apps, or HTML widgets while addressing potential issues like CSS conflicts or non-HTML outputs (e.g., generating screenshots for PDF). Here's a summary:

| Package | Description | Key Function(s) | Use Case | Installation |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| **knitr** (built-in) | Core knitr package includes a function to embed URLs as interactive iframes in HTML or screenshots in other formats (requires webshot2 and Chrome). | `include_url()` | Embedding external web pages or Shiny apps directly in code chunks. Supports figure-like options (e.g., `out.width`, `fig.cap`). Example: ```` ```{r} knitr::include_url("https://example.com", height="400px") ``` ```` | `install.packages("knitr")` (usually pre-installed). |
| **widgetframe** | Wraps htmlwidgets (e.g., leaflet, DT, plotly) in responsive iframes to isolate them from parent document CSS/JS conflicts. Useful for books or websites. | `frameWidget()`, `frameableWidget()` | Embedding interactive widgets without styling interference. Example: ```` library(leaflet); library(widgetframe); l <- leaflet() %>% addTiles(); frameWidget(l) ```` (renders in iframe). | `install.packages("widgetframe")` |
| **webshot2** (dependency) | Takes screenshots of web pages for non-HTML outputs when used with `include_url()`. | N/A (supports knitr) | Fallback for PDF/Word outputs. | `install.packages("webshot2")` |

These are the primary ones focused on iframes. Raw HTML `<iframe>` tags can also be inserted directly in R Markdown (e.g., via ```` ```{=html} <iframe src="https://example.com"></iframe> ``` ````), but the packages above provide more robust, programmable handling.

### For Quarto

Quarto does not have dedicated packages or extensions *exclusively* focused on iframes, as its Pandoc-based system allows seamless embedding of raw HTML iframes in `.qmd` files for HTML outputs (including reveal.js presentations). This is the standard approach documented in Quarto's guides. However, there are community resources and built-in features that support iframe usage:

- **Raw HTML Blocks**: Embed iframes directly for interactive content.
  - Example:

````
    ``{=html}
    <iframe src="https://example.com" width="100%" height="400px" title="Embedded Page"></iframe>
    ``
````
  - Works in documents, websites, and presentations. For full-width/height, use CSS classes like `{.column-screen}`.

- **Reveal.js Background Iframes**: Built-in support for embedding webpages as non-interactive slide backgrounds in presentations.
  - Example YAML: `background-iframe: "https://example.com"`.
  - Limitation: Content can't rely on external JS dependencies.

- **Video Embedding**: Quarto's "{< video >}" shortcode uses iframes internally for YouTube/Vimeo/Brightcove (e.g., "{< video https://youtu.be/wo9vZccmqwc >}"). 
>NOTE. took off "{}" so doc would render

- **Community Gallery**: The `quarto-iframe-examples` GitHub repo provides a collection of pre-made iframe examples for presentations (e.g., animated backgrounds). Clone and adapt: `git clone https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-iframe-examples`.

- **Quarto Extensions**: No official iframe-specific extension in the [extensions gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/), but you can create custom ones using Lua filters for advanced iframe handling (e.g., responsive sizing).

For both tools, ensure HTML output for interactivity; non-HTML formats (e.g., PDF) require screenshots via tools like webshot2. If you're facing rendering issues (e.g., black screens in older R Markdown versions), update to the latest rmarkdown/knitr and check browser settings.
